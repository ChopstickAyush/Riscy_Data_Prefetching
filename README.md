Our project was improving Data Prefetching technique for SPEC, SAT Solvers, Graph Analytics and Server traces. We tested a total of 
This work is built upon IPCP 1.0 by Biswa, which uses a bouquet of prefetchers. We are proposing a series of specialized improvements for different categories like Graphs, Sat-solvers, SPEC traces and Server workloads, leading to a prefetcher which performs at par or better than IPCP for most traces. The ideas used in this work have been built upon from various DPC3 submissions

| Traces  | Speed-up |
|---------|----------|
| GRAPH   | 1.072    |
| SAT     | 1.007    |
| SPEC    | 0.999    |
| SERVER  | 1.001    |
